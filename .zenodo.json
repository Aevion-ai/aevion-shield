  "title": "Aevion Shield: First Formally Verified Byzantine AI Consensus",
  "description": "The first Byzantine fault-tolerant AI consensus system with machine-checked formal verification across three theorem provers: Lean 4 (63 theorems), Verus (Rust), and Prusti (contracts). Empirical validation on 500-sample GSM8K benchmark demonstrates 92.8% baseline accuracy degrading to only 83.0% under 33% Byzantine attack (p < 0.001). Constitutional halt mechanism triggers when agreement falls below 67%, achieving 57.8% halt rate under majority Byzantine conditions. This work establishes prior art for Byzantine AI consensus verification as of February 2026.",
